# Housing

### Meeting of Campaign Lab on Tuesday 16 October 2018
We discussed a series of ideas that could be interesting to explore further in the housing domain, including the following:
- That Labor did better in cities than in towns in the last election
- That Labor did better with younger, university-educated voters in the last election
- Traditionally, Labor does better in areas with more social housing
- That young people are decreasingly in a position to buy a house (much later than their parents tended to be)
- That younger people are buying houses outside metropolitan areas where prices are lower, rather than being able to stay in the area where they grew up
- That the ratio of income to house prices has declined steeply over the last several decades, and the age at which people buy a house has on average gone up
- That policy makers assume that they will lose votes if they increase council taxes, and it would be extremely positive to have data to indicate whether there is a relationship between voting and council tax increases.
